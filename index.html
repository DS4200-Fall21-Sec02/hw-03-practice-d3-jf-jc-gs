      The first visualization below takes a high-level look at some of the impacts of COVID-19 on flights. <br><br> 
      In addition, the second visualization is a look at revenues for a simulated company among different branches.

    The above visualization is generated by using a dataset sourced from Kaggle (see source above visualization). This dataset includes airport traffic data between March and December 2020. This visualization is the first step in exploring trends related to COVID-19, travel, and the macro economy. While this graph does not specifically identify a trendline, one can see the general increase and decrease of airline traffic throughout 2020.

    A scatter plot is the most appropriate encoding for this data. As there is one ordinal attribute and one quantitative attribute, we could either have selected a line chart or scatter plot. However, as this is a hypothetical start to an analysis, we decided a scatter plot would better show the overall state of the data; the next chart to create would be a line chart showing the average flight volume vs. time. In addition, due to the quantity of airports presented, we elected to use one color for the entire scatter plot rather than using dozens of colors to identify each airport. This is an intentional design element used to focus viewers on the broader trend rather than focusing on geographies or individual airports.

      <b> Simulated business revenues among different branches </b>

    The above visualization is generated by using simulated dataset created by the team. This dataset includes simulated revenue information for a hypothetical business that has four branches around the US: NYC, Boston, San Francisco, and Portland. We chose to use this dataset to illustrate how one might choose to analyze high-level business trends across geographies. For example, from this chart, one could conclude Portland is experiencing consistent growth, or that Boston may experience greater seasonality compared to other geographies. 

    <br><br>
    A grouped bar chart is the most appropriate encoding for this data. As we have an ordinal attribute, categorical attribute, and quantitative attribute, a visualization requires either a line chart or bar chart for presentation. In this example, we feel as though a grouped bar chart is as valid as a line chart and can be substituted. Color is used to identitify locations.
